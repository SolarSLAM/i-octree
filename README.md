# [i-Octree: A Fast, Lightweight,  and Dynamic  Octree for Proximity  Search(Accepted by ICRA 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08315)

**i-Octree** is a dynamic octree data structure that supports both fast nearest neighbor search and real-time dynamic updates, such as point insertion, deletion, and on-tree down-sampling. The i-Octree is built upon a leaf-based octree and has two key features: a local spatially continuous storing strategy that allows for fast access to points while minimizing memory usage, and local on-tree updates that significantly reduce computation time compared to existing static or dynamic tree structures. 

## Features
- Dynamically insert points to the tree.
- Delete points inside given axis-aligned bounding boxes.
- Fast k-nearest neighbors search.
- Fast radius neighbors search.
- Fully templated for maximal flexibility to support arbitrary point representations & containers.

## News ðŸ“°
### [2024.03.16] - Feature Enhancement
- Enhanced the implementation of the i-Octree with new functionalities and updated the Python bindings accordingly.

## Python Bindings Test
### 1. Requirement
To compile, we require `Eigen`, `C++17`, and `torch`.
### 2. Run
```bash
git clone git@github.com:zhujun3753/i-octee.git

cd octree_map
# Update the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` variable in `CMakeLists.txt` to reflect your own path settings.!!!!
bash build.sh

cd ..
python demo.py

```
### 3. Results
```shell
